That was a character class for digits. There are other character classes as well.

Most used are:

\d (“d” is from “digit”)
    A digit: a character from 0 to 9.
\s (“s” is from “space”)
    A space symbol: includes spaces, tabs \t, newlines \n and few other rare characters, such as \v, \f and \r.
\w (“w” is from “word”)
    A “wordly” character: either a letter of Latin alphabet or a digit or an underscore _. Non-Latin letters (like cyrillic or hindi) do not belong to \w.

For instance, \d\s\w means a “digit” followed by a “space character” followed by a “wordly character”, such as 1 a.
