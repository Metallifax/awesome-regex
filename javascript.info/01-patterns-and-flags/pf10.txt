Summary

A regular expression consists of a pattern and optional flags: g, i, m, u, s, y.

Without flags and special symbols (that we’ll study later), the search by a regexp is the same as a substring search.

The method str.match(regexp) looks for matches: all of them if there’s g flag, otherwise, only the first one.
    
The method str.replace(regexp, replacement) replaces matches found using regexp with replacement: all of them if there’s g flag, otherwise only the first one.
    
The method regexp.test(str) returns true if there’s at least one match, otherwise, it returns false.
