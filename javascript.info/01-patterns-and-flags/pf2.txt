Flags

Regular expressions may have flags that effect the search.
There are only 6 of them in JavaScript:

i
With this flag the search is case-insensitive: no difference between A and
a(see the example below).

g
With this flag the search looks for all matches, without it -only the first
match is returned.

m
Multiline mode (covered in the chapter Multiline mode of anchors ^ $ , flag
"m"). - link - https://javascript.info/regexp-multiline-mode

s
Enables 'dotall' mode, that allows a dot . to match newline character \n
(covered in the chapter Character classes). - link - https://javascript.info/regexp-character-classes

u
Enables full unicode support. The flag enables correct processing of surrogate
pairs. More about that in the chapter Unicode: flag "u" and class \p{...}.

y
"sticky" mode: searching at the exact position in the text (covered in the
chapter Sticky flag "y", searching at position)
